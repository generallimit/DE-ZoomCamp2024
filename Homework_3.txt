-- Creating materialized table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `astute-impulse-412600.ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata` AS

Question 1:
Question 1: What is count of records for the 2022 Green Taxi Data??
--840402
select count(*) from `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_external`; 



Question 2:
Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables.
What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?
--0 MB for the External Table and 6.41MB for the Materialized Table

select count(distinct pulocation_id)
from `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_external`; --process: 0.0MB

select count(distinct pulocation_id)
from `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata`; --process: 6.41MB



Question 3:
How many records have a fare_amount of 0?
--1,622

select count(*) --1622
from `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_external`
where fare_amount = 0;



Question 4:
What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always order the results by PUlocationID and filter based on lpep_pickup_datetime? (Create a new table with this strategy)
--Partition by lpep_pickup_datetime Cluster on PUlocationID

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `astute-impulse-412600.ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_partition_clustered`
PARTITION BY (lpep_pickup_date) CLUSTER BY (pulocation_id) AS
select * from `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_external`;



Question 5:
Write a query to retrieve the distinct PULocationID between lpep_pickup_datetime 06/01/2022 and 06/30/2022 (inclusive)

Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 4 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values?

Choose the answer which most closely matches.

--12.82 MB for non-partitioned table and 1.12 MB for the partitioned table

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `astute-impulse-412600.ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_partition`
PARTITION BY (lpep_pickup_date) AS
select * from `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_external`;

SELECT DISTINCT pulocation_id
FROM `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata` --12.82MB
WHERE lpep_pickup_date BETWEEN DATE '2022-01-06' AND DATE '2022-06-30';

SELECT DISTINCT pulocation_id
FROM `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_partition` --6.53
WHERE lpep_pickup_date BETWEEN DATE '2022-01-06' AND DATE '2022-06-30';

SELECT DISTINCT pulocation_id
FROM `ny_taxi.green_2022_tripdata_partition_clustered` --6.53
WHERE lpep_pickup_date BETWEEN DATE '2022-01-06' AND DATE '2022-06-30';



Question 6:
Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?
--external table referring to gcs path
GCP Bucket



Question 7:
It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data:

True
False
